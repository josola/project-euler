# Contributing 💁

Contributions are always welcome, whether they be fixing grammar issues or tackling architectural problems. Here is a quick guide on how to help out in the best way possible.

- Check out issues to see if your problem has been identified by others.
  
- Make your fix, whatever it may be, on a forked repository and on its own branch.
  
- Propose fixes by submitting pull requests to the main branch.
